 ## Other Examples
 
 ```bash
 # Check custom rules - this ensures all regular expressions compile, and can match the rule's `examples` in the YML file
 kingfisher rules check --rules-path ./my_rules.yml
 
 # List GitHub repos
 kingfisher github repos list --user my-user
 kingfisher github repos list --organization my-org
 
 ```
 
 ## Notable Scan Options
 
 - `--no-dedup`: Report every occurrence of a finding (disable the default de-duplicate behavior)
 - `--confidence <LEVEL>`: (low|medium|high)
 - `--min-entropy <VAL>`: Override default threshold
 - `--no-binary`: Skip binary files
 - `--no-extract-archives`: Do not scan inside archives
 - `--extraction-depth <N>`: Specifies how deep nested archives should be extracted and scanned (default: 2)
 - `--redact`: Replaces discovered secrets with a one-way hash for secure output
 - `--exclude <PATTERN>`: Skip any file or directory whose path matches this glob pattern (repeatable, uses gitignore-style syntax, case sensitive)
 - `--baseline-file <FILE>`: Ignore matches listed in a baseline YAML file
 - `--manage-baseline`: Create or update the baseline file with current findings
+- `--skip-regex <PATTERN>`: Ignore findings whose text matches this regex (repeatable)
+- `--skip-word <WORD>`: Ignore findings containing this case-insensitive word (repeatable)
 
 
 ## Finding Fingerprint
 
 The document below details the four-field formula (rule SHA-1, origin label, start & end offsets) hashed with XXH3-64 to create Kingfisher’s 64-bit finding fingerprint, and explains how this ID powers safe deduplication; plus how `--no-dedup` can be used shows every raw match.
 See ([docs/FINGERPRINT.md](docs/FINGERPRINT.md))
 
 ## Rule Performance Profiling
 
 Use `--rule-stats` to collect timing information for every rule. After scanning, the summary prints a **Rule Performance Stats** section showing how many matches each rule produced along with its slowest and average match times. Useful when creating rules or debugging rules.
 
 ## CLI Options
 
 ```bash
 kingfisher scan --help
 ```
 
 ## Business Value
 
 By integrating Kingfisher into your development lifecycle, you can:
 
 - **Prevent Costly Breaches**  
   Early detection of embedded credentials avoids expensive incident response, legal fees, and reputation damage
 - **Automate Compliance**  
   Enforce secret‑scanning policies across GitOps, CI/CD, and pull requests to help satisfy SOC 2, PCI‑DSS, GDPR, and other standards
